## Overview

**SmartCafe** is a Python-based application designed to manage the daily operations of a cafe efficiently. It provides a simple command-line interface for staff to:

- Browse a structured menu of Beverages, Food, Desserts, and Snacks.
- Take customer orders with real-time price calculation.
- Persistently store all order data.
- Review order history and track total revenue.

The entire project follows an object-oriented design, making the code modular, readable, and easy to extend.

## Features

- **Menu Management**: Pre-configured menu categories (Beverages, Food, Desserts, Snacks) with items and prices.
- **Order Processing**: Take customer orders, automatically calculate totals, and store them.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: All order data and revenue are automatically saved in a JSON file (`database/cafe_data.json`) between sessions.
- **Revenue Tracking**: View total accumulated revenue at any time.
- **Order History**: Review past orders directly within the application.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean architecture using Python classes for `MenuItem`, `Order`, and `CafeManager`, promoting maintainability and scalability.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3.Run the application
```
python -m smartcafe.main
```

## File Structure
The project follows a modular and standard Python package structure.

```
Note: The database/cafe_data.json file is automatically created when you first run the application and is intentionally excluded from version control via .gitignore.

## How It Works
### 1.Core Logic (smartcafe/core_logic.py):

- Defines the foundational MenuItem class with name and price attributes.

- Contains the Order class to hold a list of MenuItem objects, calculate the total, and generate a timestamp.

- Implements the CafeManager class, which orchestrates all operations: initializing the menu categorically, taking orders, saving/loading data to/from database/cafe_data.json, and viewing history/revenue.

### 2.Entry Point (smartcafe/main.py):

- Creates an instance of CafeManager.

- Presents a user-friendly, looped command-line menu, allowing the user to interact with all features until they choose to exit.
